Expanding renewable energy generation capacity across the Mekong helps diversify the region’s electricity mix and reduce reliance on hydropower capacity. JUMPP assists countries with technical assistance supporting strong energy markets and reliably integrating renewable energy to ensure citizens have access to reliable, secure, and affordable energy supplies to support economic growth and prosperity. <br/> <br/><br/></p>
