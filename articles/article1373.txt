<p>For more than 30 years, the Clean Air Act has provided California with an ability to set standards that control of emissions from new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines. And since that time, California has worked hand-in-hand with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to drive life-saving air pollution reductions, while spurring invention and investment in technologies and materials that enable the next generation of motor vehicles.<br/><br/>Building on the momentum from California’s 2020 Framework Agreement on Clean Cars, the EPA set the most ambitious motor vehicle emissions standards in history and today, reinstated the California Waiver. Together, these steps provide the opportunity for the Biden-Harris Administration and the State of California under Governor Newsom’s leadership, to once again move forward in the direction of a harmonized national program that will benefit families all across America.</p>
