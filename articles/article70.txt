<p>We strongly disagree with the District Court’s ruling on our student debt relief program and the Department of Justice has filed an appeal.<br/> <br/>The President and this Administration are determined to help working and middle-class Americans get back on their feet, while our opponents – backed by extreme Republican special interests – sued to block millions of Americans from getting much-needed relief.<br/> <br/>For the 26 million borrowers who have already given the Department of Education the necessary information to be considered for debt relief – 16 million of whom have already been approved for relief – the Department will hold onto their information so it can quickly process their relief once we prevail in court. <br/> <br/>We will never stop fighting for hardworking Americans most in need – no matter how many roadblocks our opponents and special interests try to put in our way. </p>
