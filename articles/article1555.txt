<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Welcome, everyone.  I’m delighted to have the Chancellor here today — Chancellor Scholz.  We’ve met before, but this is the first time I’m able to host you in the White House.  And it’s good to have a chance to get to know you more personally.  And we’re going to spend some time alone together, I hope. </p>
<p>And, you know, to state the obvious, Germany is one of America’s closest allies.  We’re working in lockstep to further deter Russian aggression in Europe and to address the challenges posed by China and to promote stability in the We- — in the Western Balkans. </p>
<p>We then — we have to take on the pandemic, climate change, and — among many others issues.  So, we have a lot to talk about, Mr. Chancellor — Chancellor, and — Olaf.  And I’m — I’m looking forward to us working closely together with you and this year during Germany’s presence at the G7.  I’m looking forward to that as well.  So, welcome, welcome, welcome. </p>
<p>The floor is yours, sir, if you wish to say anything.</p>
<p>CHANCELLOR SCHOLZ:  Yeah.  Thank you for having me here.  And, really, I appreciate very much that we have the chance to discuss all the topics you raised.  They are very important. </p>
<p>We are closest allies and working intensely together.  And this is necessary for doing the steps that we have to do — for instance, fighting against Russian aggression against Ukraine.</p>
<p>So, it’s an important meeting at a very, very important time.  </p>
<p>PRESIDENT BIDEN:  Thank you all.</p>
