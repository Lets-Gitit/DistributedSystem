<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Culmination of Talent Pipeline Challenge brings together hundreds of partners to train Americans for good jobs building a better America.</em></p>
<p>Today, President Biden will recognize the commitments made by more than 350 organizations in 50 states and territories as part of the Infrastructure Talent Pipeline Challenge. The Challenge, launched by the Biden-Harris Administration in June, is a nationwide call to action for employers, unions, education and training providers, states, local governments, Tribes, territories, philanthropic organizations, and other stakeholders to make tangible commitments that support equitable workforce development focused on three critical sectors: <span style="text-decoration: underline">broadband</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline">construction</span>, and <span style="text-decoration: underline">electrification</span>. </p>
<p>The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law—along with the CHIPS and Science Act, Inflation Reduction Act, and American Rescue Plan—are creating millions of good-paying union jobs, and the Challenge aimed to ensure that workers across the country are trained for these jobs. The private, public, and non-profit sector commitments complement the Administration’s investments in workforce development and help ensure a diverse set of workers have a fair shot at the good jobs created.</p>
<p>Commitments made through the Challenge will expand equitable pathways into good jobs, boost opportunities for union jobs, and meet critical employer skill needs.</p>
<ul><li>Nearly 150 employers, unions, and community-based organizations will create or expand pre-apprenticeships, registered apprenticeships, and other high-quality training programs.</li><li>More than 60 organizations will increase recruitment among workers who are traditionally underrepresented in infrastructure sectors.</li><li>Nearly 30 organizations will provide supportive services, such as child care and transportation assistance, to help workers overcome barriers to participating in apprenticeships and other training opportunities.</li><li>More than 50 institutions of higher education—including over 30 community colleges and five community and technical college systems—will advance equitable workforce development for infrastructure jobs.</li><li>More than $70 million in aligned philanthropic commitments that advances the goals of the Talent Pipeline Challenge will impact tens of thousands of underrepresented workers.</li></ul>
<p>At today’s event, tradespeople from unions participating in the Challenge will demonstrate how they train workers in skills critical to implementing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. These include:</p>
