<p>Today, Vice President Kamala Harris convened more than 20 North Carolina state legislators, local leaders, and advocates who are fighting on the frontlines to protect reproductive rights.  The Vice President convened state legislators from across the country on July 8, 2022 at the White House; on July 14, 2022 in Orlando, Florida; on July 16, 2022 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and on July 18, 2022 in Atlantic City, New Jersey.<br/> <br/>During the meeting, the legislators, advocates, and providers in attendance discussed the importance of building a broad coalition to protect reproductive rights. The state legislators described how Republican leaders in North Carolina are pushing for extreme laws that would take away the right of women to make decisions about their own bodies. The Vice President thanked North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper for using every tool to protect access to reproductive health care, including a recent state executive order issued to protect patients seeking care from harassment and intimidation, and his veto of extreme legislative attacks on reproductive rights.<br/> <br/>The Vice President shared actions the Administration is taking on a national level in response to the Supreme Court overturning <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, including protecting access to abortion medication, defending the Constitutional right to travel, and addressing patient privacy. The Vice President encouraged the state legislators to keep defending the rights of women in North Carolina and said she looks forward to continuing to fight alongside them to protect the people of our nation.<br/> <br/><strong>Speakers:</strong></p>
