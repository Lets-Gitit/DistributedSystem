<p>The Inflation Reduction Act will lower costs for families, combat the climate crisis, reduce the deficit, and finally ask the largest corporations to pay their fair share. President Biden and Congressional Democrats have worked together to deliver a historic legislative achievement that defeats special interests, delivers for American families, and grows the economy from the bottom up and middle out.<br/><br/><em>Here’s how the Inflation Reduction Act impacts Americans by the numbers:</em><br/><br/><strong><u>HEALTH CARE</u></strong><br/><br/><strong><em>Cutting Prescription Drug Cost</em></strong></p>
