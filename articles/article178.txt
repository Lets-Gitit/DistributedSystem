<p>To lower the price of hearing aids and expand access, President Biden’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/">Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy</a> called on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to make hearing aids available over the counter, without a prescription.

FDA <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/160971/download">estimates</a> this could lower average costs by as much as $3,000 per pair—providing significant breathing room for the nearly <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3564588/">30 million Americans</a> with hearing loss, including nearly 10 million adults under age 60.<br/></p>
