<p>Yesterday, National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy convened the tenth meeting of the National Climate Task Force with Cabinet members and senior leadership from across the Biden-Harris Administration. The Task Force focused on how agencies can continue supporting the President’s commitment to addressing Putin’s Price Hike from his unprovoked war against Ukraine, minimizing pain at the pump here at home, continue rapidly deploying clean energy, and keep reducing emissions that cause climate change.</p>
<p>The Task Force echoed the President’s belief that this moment underscores the need to accelerate – not slow down – our transition to a clean energy future that will strengthen U.S. energy independence. They noted when electric cars are powered by clean energy, homes run on clean electricity, and our grid is more resilient and reliable, autocrats like Putin won’t be able to weaponize fossil fuels against other nations. Officials discussed building a clean energy future by furthering the Task Force’s work every day and advancing the President’s legislative agenda that provides tax credits to save families money, lower energy bills, boost U.S. manufacturing jobs, and promote competition.</p>
<p>Task Force members also discussed progress across government to achieve the President’s ambitious climate goals. A new Climate-Smart Infrastructure Working Group outlined efforts to ensure Bipartisan Infrastructure Law investments are resilient to future climate impacts and utilize low-carbon and carbon-free materials. Energy Secretary Granholm previewed upcoming work to make schools more energy efficient and cleaner for our children. Interior Secretary Haaland discussed how the Department of the Interior is leveraging Bipartisan Infrastructure Law investments to reclaim abandoned mines and plug orphan oil and gas wells across the country. Lastly, the Council on Environmental Quality highlighted the Administration’s continued commitment to environmental justice and their progress deploying the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool.</p>
