<p>Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)</p>
<p>Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the <em>Federal Register</em> and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the <em>Federal Register</em> for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national emergency declared with respect to Yemen in Executive Order 13611 of May 16, 2012, is to continue in effect beyond May 16, 2022.</p>
<p>The actions and policies of certain former members of the Government of Yemen and others in threatening Yemen’s peace, security, and stability continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.  Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13611 with respect to Yemen.</p>
<p>                               Sincerely,</p>
<p>                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>
