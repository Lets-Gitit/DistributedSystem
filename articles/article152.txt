<p>I congratulate Giorgia Meloni on becoming the new Prime Minister of Italy. Italy is a vital NATO Ally and close partner as our nations together address shared global challenges. As leaders in the G7, I look forward to continuing to advance our support for Ukraine, hold Russia accountable for its aggression, ensure respect for human rights and democratic values, and build sustainable economic growth.</p>
