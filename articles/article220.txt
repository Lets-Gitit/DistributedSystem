<p>Today, MAGA Congressional Republicans <a href="https://www.lankford.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Lankford%20Lee%20Protect%20Drug%20Innovation%20Act.pdf">introduced legislation</a> that puts special interests before working families. Their new bill is a giveaway to big pharma at the expense of seniors by ending Medicareâ€™s new ability to negotiate lower drug prices. Their vision for the country is extreme and out of touch with working families across the country.</p>
