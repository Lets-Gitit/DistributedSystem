<p>The Senate took an important step today with the bipartisan agreement announced by Chair Tester and Ranking Member Moran to advance the <em>Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act of 2022, </em>their version of the Honoring Our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022. President Biden has championed legislation to deliver the benefits and health care services that veterans impacted by toxic exposures have earned. This historic, comprehensive bill will do just that. </p>
<p>The PACT Act will not only help deliver more timely access to benefits and services for veterans and their survivors, it will also ensure that the Department of Veterans Affairs can act more nimbly to add future presumptive conditions when the evidence warrants. And, the legislation will help VA provide our veterans the level of service they deserve.</p>
<p>President Biden believes that we have a sacred obligation to support veterans, their families, caregivers, and survivors. That’s why, as part of his first State of the Union address, he identified supporting veterans as a key pillar of his Unity Agenda and an issue that can unite the country — Republicans and Democrats. Passing the PACT Act would be a welcome and long-awaited achievement for the veterans who have served us so well.  </p>
