<p>Americans all across the country are back at work in record numbers. 22 states – a record high – have unemployment rates at or below 3 percent, and 14 states now have their lowest unemployment rate on record.  This is the latest sign that my Administration’s economic plan is working.  Last month, America created 528,000 jobs and matched the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years. </p>
<p>My infrastructure law and CHIPS and Science law are already bringing investments to make more here in America and create good jobs, and the Inflation Reduction Act will build on that even further. We are finally building an economy that works for working families. And, we continue to see signs of progress on fighting inflation and lowering gas prices. I promised to build the economy from the bottom up and middle out – we have more work to do, but we’re making progress.</p>
