<p>Yesterday, Senior Advisor to the President for Clean Energy Innovation and Implementation John Podesta and National Climate Advisor Ali Zaidi convened a meeting of the National Climate Task Force to discuss implementing President Biden’s historic Inflation Reduction Act and how it will lower energy costs for American families, promote energy security, create good-paying jobs, advance environmental justice, and position the U.S. to meet the President’s ambitious climate goals.</p>
<p>The Task Force received a briefing from Secretary of Treasury Janet Yellen on the ongoing work to provide guidance for taxpayers on Inflation Reduction Act provisions that benefit consumers and support the deployment of clean energy technologies. The Task Force also received a briefing from Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry on the upcoming COP27 conference in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, as well as a briefing from Council on Environmental Quality Chair Brenda Mallory on how the Administration is advancing the President’s commitment to environmental justice and delivering on the President’s Justice40 commitment.</p>
<p>The Inflation Reduction Act is the most aggressive action on climate in American history, and together with bold actions from across the Task Force agencies and investments from the President’s other legislative accomplishments, including the American Rescue Plan, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the United States is leading the world once again on the international stage. The Task Force reaffirmed that climate change disproportionately impacts low-income communities and communities of color, and members committed to prioritize programs in the Inflation Reduction Act alongside other executive actions that address legacy pollution, and ensure that all Americans can benefit from the job creation opportunities and lower costs associated with clean energy.</p>
