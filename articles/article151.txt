<p>Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)<br/><br/>Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 <em>et seq.</em>), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 <em>et seq.</em>), the Nicaragua Investment Conditionality Act of 2018 (50 U.S.C. 1701 note), section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (8 U.S.C. 1182(f)), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I hereby report that I have issued an Executive Order to take additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13851 of November 27, 2018 (Blocking Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the Situation in Nicaragua).<br/><br/>I have determined that additional measures are necessary to address the national emergency with respect to the situation in Nicaragua to increase targeted pressure on the Ortega-Murillo regime to change its malign behavior.  This will afford my Administration additional financial tools with which to target the regime while allowing the flexibility necessary to continue supporting the people of Nicaragua.<br/><br/>Specifically, I find that the violent response by the Government of Nicaragua to the protests that began on April 18, 2018, and the Ortega regime’s systematic dismantling and undermining of democratic institutions and the rule of law, its use of widespread violence and repressive tactics against its people, as well as its corruption leading to the destabilization of Nicaragua’s economy, have not only continued, but worsened.  Since Nicaragua’s November 2021 sham elections, the limited remaining democratic space in the country has dramatically shrunk as over hundreds of non-governmental organizations have been shuttered and political prisoners have been subjected to extremely harsh conditions.  These increased abuses of human rights and fundamental freedoms continue to constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States.  I hereby amend Executive Order 13851 to elaborate upon measures to address the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13851 to address that threat.<br/><br/>I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.</p>
