<p>This morning, the Office of the National Cyber Director (ONCD) convened government and private-sector leaders in a forum focused on cybersecurity issues in the electric vehicle (EV) and electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) ecosystem. This forum occurred as part of a larger series of executive-level meetings targeting various sectors, most recently a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/16/readout-of-healthcare-cybersecurity-executive-forum-hosted-by-national-cyber-director-chris-inglis/">healthcare-focused</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ncdinglis/status/1537539397322780677">event</a> in June, intended to support strategic awareness and preparedness and to strengthen all parts of critical infrastructure.<br/><br/>National Cyber Director Chris Inglis and Principal Deputy National Cyber Director Kemba Walden hosted Polly Trottenberg, Deputy Secretary, Department of Transportation; David Turk, Deputy Secretary, Department of Energy; Mitch Landrieu, Senior Advisor to the President and Infrastructure Implementation Coordinator; Anne Neuberger, Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber &amp; Emerging Technology on the National Security Council; Kristina Costa, Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy for Clean Energy Innovation &amp; Implementation; Caitlin Durkovich, Deputy Homeland Security Advisor for Resilience &amp; Response; other senior government officials; and senior executives representing stakeholders in the EV and EVSE ecosystem for a cyber threat and vulnerability briefing and a roundtable discussion on cybersecurity. Officials emphasized the importance of partnering closely with the private sector in order to ensure resilience and robustness are essential characteristics of the EV ecosystem.<br/><br/>Industry participants—who included representatives from auto manufacturers, component manufacturers, and EV charging infrastructure manufacturers—were asked for and shared the views of their individual organizations on current cybersecurity practices, gaps, and recommendations for improvement throughout the EV ecosystem. Government officials noted that building a secure and resilient ecosystem for EVs and EVSE is important to achieving climate policy goals safely and securely. Government officials shared how they are driving towards these goals through implementation of investments of over $7.5 billion in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) funds for EV charging infrastructure and billions more in tax credits and direct investments as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. All participants emphasized the need to accelerate construction and deployment of this critical infrastructure while ensuring that, as Americans increasingly rely on it, we are confident in its security and resilience. There was also discussion about how the Administration’s implementation of the Build America, Buy America Act could improve the supply chain security of components that all of the companies rely on.<br/><br/>Participants agreed that the public and private sectors, including a diverse array of stakeholders in the EV ecosystem, will work together to:</p>
<ul><li>Assess the current state of cybersecurity standards across the EV and EVSE ecosystem and identify opportunities for harmonization;</li><li>Identify key cybersecurity attributes needed for the emerging EV and EVSE ecosystem and outline a shared vision of the future state; and</li><li>Assess the state of cybersecurity research and development for the EV and EVSE ecosystem and identify opportunities for further work.</li></ul>
