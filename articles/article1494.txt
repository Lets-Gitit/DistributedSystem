<p>9:17 A.M. EDT   <br/> <br/>Q    Mr. President, how high is the threat of a Russian invasion right now? <br/> <br/>THE PRESIDENT:  It’s very high.<br/> <br/>Q    Why?<br/> <br/>THE PRESIDENT:  It’s very — because they have not — they have not moved any of their troops out.  They’ve moved more troops in, number one.  Number two, we have reason to believe that they are engaged in a false-flag operation to have an excuse to go in.  Every indication we have is they’re prepared to go into Ukraine, attack Ukraine — number one. <br/> <br/>Number two, I’ve been waiting for a response from Putin for my letter that — my response to him.  It’s come to that Moscow embassy.  They’re faxing it here.  Not faxing it, they’re sending it here.  I have not read it yet.  I cannot comment on it.<br/> <br/>Q    Have you been briefed on it in any way?<br/> <br/>THE PRESIDENT:  No- —<br/> <br/>Q    Do you think he’s going to go through with this, sir?  Is your sense that this is going to happen now?<br/> <br/>THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  Not —<br/> <br/>Q    When?<br/> <br/>THE PRESIDENT:  I — my sense is this will happen within the next several days. <br/> <br/>Thank you.<br/> <br/>Q    How many days are we talking?<br/> <br/>Q    Is there any diplomatic path still available, Mr. President? <br/> <br/>THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, there is.  There’s a clear diplomatic path.  That’s why I asked Senator — Senator — (laughs) — Secretary Blinken to go to the United Nations and make his statement today.  He’ll lay out what that path is.  I’ve laid out a path to Putin as well on, I think, Sunday.  And so, there is a path.  There is a way through this, but by diplomacy.<br/> <br/>Q    Will you speak to Putin again? <br/> <br/>Q    Are you going to call Putin?<br/> <br/>THE PRESIDENT:  I’m not calling Putin.  I have no plans to call Putin right now.  Thank you.<br/> <br/>9:18 A.M.
