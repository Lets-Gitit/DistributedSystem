<p>Today, President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. made additional disaster assistance available to the State of New Mexico by authorizing an increase in the level of Federal funding for debris removal and emergency protective measures undertaken in the State of New Mexico as a result of wildfires and straight-line winds beginning on April 5, 2022, and continuing.</p>
<p>Under the President’s major disaster declaration issued for the State of New Mexico on May 4, 2022, Federal funding was made available for Public Assistance, Hazard Mitigation, and Other Needs Assistance at 75 percent of the total eligible costs.</p>
<p>Under the President’s order today, the Federal share for debris removal and emergency protective measures, including direct Federal assistance has been increased to 100 percent of the total eligible costs for the first 90 days of the incident period. The 90 day period is designed to serve as a bridge between emergency operations and the potential passage of the pending Hermits Peak Fire Assistance Act legislation that would require FEMA to establish a claims office to enable individuals to apply for a broader range of assistance than what is available under the Stafford Act.</p>
<p>This additional support will help ensure that New Mexico has no financial limitations related to immediate lifesaving and life sustaining operations related to the ongoing wildfires, including urgent debris removal.</p>
