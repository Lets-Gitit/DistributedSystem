<p>The United States and the Philippines enjoy an alliance and partnership based on deep historical, economic, and cultural ties, and our shared democratic values.  The United States and the Philippines stand together as friends, partners, and allies.  Now and always, the U.S. commitment to the defense of the Philippines is ironclad, and we are committed to strengthening our economic and investment relationship.<br/> <br/>The Vice President’s travel to the Philippines reaffirms the bilateral alliance and will spur cooperation on a range of issues, including:  advancing clean energy, addressing the climate crisis, promoting inclusive growth and innovation, increasing access to quality education and health resources, combating trafficking in persons, facing common security challenges, supporting freedom of the seas, and deepening people-to-people ties.<br/> <br/>The Vice President is launching the following initiatives.<br/> <br/><strong>CLIMATE ACTION, ENERGY SECURITY, AND SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE</strong></p>
<ul><li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Energy Policy Dialogue: </span>The U.S Department of Energy, U.S. Department of State, and Philippine Department of Energy will establish an Energy Policy Dialogue, a high-level platform for the two nations to develop new forms of energy cooperation, including on short and long-term energy planning, offshore wind development, and grid stability and power transmission.</li></ul>
<ul><li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Launching 123 Agreement Negotiations for Civil Nuclear Energy Cooperation:</span> The Vice President announced that the United States and the Philippines are initiating negotiations on a civil nuclear cooperation agreement (“123 agreement”) to support expanded cooperation on zero-emission energy and nonproliferation priorities.  Once in force, this agreement will provide the legal basis for U.S. exports of nuclear equipment and material to the Philippines. The United States is committed to working with the Philippines to increase energy security and deploying advanced nuclear reactor technology as quickly as safety and security conditions permit to meet the Philippines’ dire baseload power needs.  Such a deployment would support both energy security and climate goals, as well as support workers and businesses in both countries.</li></ul>

Partnering more strategically with regional financiers will ensure high-quality infrastructure projects are financed and implemented using U.S. technology and expertise, creating mutual benefit among the Philippines, the United States, and the broader Indo-Pacific Region.</li></ul>
<ul><li><span style="text-decoration: underline">Indo-Pacific Smart and Secure Ports Development:  </span>Through this project, the United States will help build partner capacity to identify and mitigate cybersecurity risks in critical seaport infrastructure.  It will also promote the use of trusted vendors for the installation and maintenance of digital and automated port infrastructure, as ports modernize and become “smarter” and “greener.” </li></ul>
<p> <br/><strong>ENHANCED DEFENSE COOPERATION AGREEMENT</strong></p>
<ul><li>The 2014 Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) builds on the 1951 Mutual Defense Treaty and 1999 Visiting Forces Agreement, providing a legal basis for Philippine and American service members to undertake security cooperation exercises, pursue joint and combined military training activities, and rapidly respond to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief efforts from agreed locations in the Philippines, on a rotational basis. EDCA sites have also been used by U.S. and Philippine forces during Kamandag and Balikatan military exercises.</li></ul>
<ul><li>The United States has allocated over $82 million towards EDCA implementation at all five existing locations. This investment, and forthcoming additional allotment, will complete 21 projects, enabling the United States and the Philippines to build lasting security infrastructure to promote long-term modernization, build a credible mutual defense posture, maintain humanitarian assistance and disaster relief capabilities, and enhance the strength of the alliance.</li></ul>
<ul><li>New EDCA locations have also been identified to enable the United States and the Philippines to continue to work together towards achieving the agreed objectives under EDCA.</li></ul>
