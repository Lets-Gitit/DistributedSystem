She spoke about how people do not need to abandon their faith to believe the government should not interfere in the ability of women to make decisions about their own bodies. She also expressed concerns about other rights that are in jeopardy, including the right to marry someone you love and the ability to access contraception. The Vice President shared actions the Administration is taking to defend abortion access, and she spoke about the importance of building a movement to protect reproductive rights.
