<p><em>President of the United States of America Joseph R. Biden Jr., President of the Republic of Indonesia Joko Widodo, and President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, issued the following statement on the side event on the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) during the G20 Summit of Leaders.</em><br/><br/>Today, Indonesia, the United States, and the European Union co-hosted an event on the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) on the margins of the G20 Leaders’ Summit, in which we reaffirmed our shared commitment to strengthening global partnerships for high-standard investments in sustainable, transparent, and quality infrastructure in low- and middle-income countries. In line with the G20 theme for 2022, “Recover Together, Recover Stronger,” the event highlighted ways in which G20 nations are investing together and investing stronger to meet the critical challenges that the world faces today.<br/><br/>Quality infrastructure is critical to countries’ development outcomes, global supply chains, economic and national security, and the health and wellbeing of the planet and people around the world. That is why at the June G7 Leaders’ Summit in Germany, Leaders launched PGII and announced their intention to mobilize $600 billion for global infrastructure investments by 2027.<br/><br/>Today’s side event demonstrated the importance of partnerships in pursuit of quality infrastructure among G20 members. The co-hosts and participants— who included Argentina, Canada, France, Germany, India, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Senegal, and the United Kingdom—announced new projects and new forms of collaboration in investments in key sectors such as climate and energy transition, digital connectivity, health and health security, education and gender equality, and transportation.<br/><br/>During the event, we also launched the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/15/indonesia-and-international-partners-secure-groundbreaking-climate-targets-and-associated-financing/">ground-breaking new Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP)</a> with President Joko Widodo of Indonesia co-led by the United States and Japan on behalf of the G7 and the International Partnership Group (IPG), including Canada, Denmark, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, and the United Kingdom. This long-term partnership will accelerate Indonesia’s just power sector transition, consistent with keeping the 1.5 °C global warming limit within reach, backed by $20 billion in support from public and private sources.<br/><br/>President of the Republic of Indonesia Joko Widodo said:<br/><br/><em>Indonesia is proud to help mobilize the game changing global goal to catalyse $600 billion in infrastructure investment by 2027. As the G20 Presidency, and Chairman of ASEAN next year, Indonesia will ensure developing countries benefit from this transformational global initiative, by working closely with partners, including in ASEAN and the Indo-Pacific region, to deliver the </em><em>Partnership Global for Infrastructure and Investment</em><em> vision to invest in infrastructure for the future, and realize Indonesia’s G20 Presidency vision to ‘Recover Together, Recover Strong’.</em><br/><br/><em>To accelerate clean energy transitions across the archipelago, Indonesia also benefits through a major $20 billion investment, the new Just Energy Transition Partnership supported by the International Partners Group.</em><br/><br/>President of the United States of America Joseph R. Biden said:<br/><br/><em>The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment brings together partners—from government<s>s</s>, the private sector, and beyond—to deliver real results for people around the world, including here in Indonesia. Today, G20 leaders highlighted the importance of investing together and investing stronger to fill the enormous need for better infrastructure in low- and middle-income countries around the world, and we welcome all who share this vision to join our efforts.</em><br/><br/>President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said:<br/><br/><em>The Partnership Global for Infrastructure and Investment is an important geostrategic initiative in era of strategic competition. Together with leading democracies we offer values-driven, high-standard, and transparent infrastructure partnerships for low- and middle-income countries. The launched Just Energy Transition Partnership with Indonesia is a critical example.</em><br/><br/>Investments announced by the United States of America can be found <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/11/15/fact-sheet-presidents-biden-widodo-von-der-leyen-and-g20-announce-g20-partnership-for-global-infrastructure-and-investment-projects/">here</a>.<br/><br/>Investments announced by the European Commission can be found <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/FS_22_6884">here</a>.<br/>  </p>
