<p>President Biden is announcing three new nominees to serve as U.S. Attorneys. These are officials who will be indispensable to upholding the rule of law as top federal law enforcement officials.</p>
<p>These individuals were chosen for their devotion to enforcing the law, their professionalism, their experience and credentials, their dedication to pursuing equal justice for all, and their commitment to the independence of the Department of Justice.</p>
<p>The President has proposed a budget that would significantly increase funding for law enforcement as part of a comprehensive approach to tackling the rising crime rate this administration inherited last year.</p>
<p>The President has also launched a comprehensive effort to take on the uptick in gun crime that has been taking place since 2020—putting more cops on the beat, supporting community prevention programs, and cracking down on illegal gun trafficking. Confirming U.S. Attorneys as the chief federal law enforcement officers in their district is important for these efforts.</p>
<p>The President has now announced 60 nominees to serve as U.S. Attorneys.</p>
