<p class="has-text-align-left"><br/> Today, during a White House event with Vice President Harris, Federal Communications Commission Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, and Senior Advisor Mitch Landrieu, the Biden-Harris Administration is announcing more than 10 million households are enrolled in the Affordable Connectivity Program, the nation’s largest ever broadband affordability program. The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to removing barriers to high-speed, affordable internet access. Thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, millions of families who previously could not get online or struggled to pay for this modern-day necessity are now connected. <br/><br/>The President and Vice President have made it a top priority to ensure all Americans have access to reliable, affordable, high-speed internet to learn, work, and participate in the 21st century economy. Broadband connectivity is vital for work, school, health care and more. But affordable broadband remains out of reach for too many, with one estimate showing almost one out of three internet users worried about paying their internet bills during the pandemic. President Biden, Vice President Harris, and the entire Administration are committed to changing this through implementation of the broadband provisions of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that address the affordability of internet service, a modern-day necessity.<br/><br/>WHAT IS THE AFFORDABLE CONNECTIVITY PROGRAM?<br/><br/>The Affordable Connectivity Program is the nation’s largest broadband affordability program.  Created through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, it is a $14.2 billion successor program to the Emergency Broadband Benefit.  Low-income households are encouraged to apply to receive a discount of up to $30 per month toward internet service and up to $75 per month for eligible households on Tribal lands.  Eligible households can also receive a one-time discount of up to $100 to purchase a laptop, desktop computer, or tablet from participating providers if the household contributes more than $10 and less than $50 toward the purchase price.<br/><br/>WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE AFFORDABLE CONNECTIVITY PROGRAM?<br/><br/>A household is eligible for the Affordable Connectivity Program if the household income is at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines, or if a member of the household meets at least <em>one</em> of the criteria below:</p>
<ul><li>Participates in certain assistance programs, such as SNAP, Medicaid, Federal Public Housing Assistance, SSI, WIC, or Lifeline;</li><li>Participates in Tribal specific programs, such as Bureau of Indian Affairs General Assistance, Tribal TANF, or Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations;</li><li>Eligible to participate in the National School Lunch Program or the School Breakfast Program, including through the USDA Community Eligibility Provision;</li><li>Received a Federal Pell Grant during the current award year; or</li><li>Meets the eligibility criteria for a participating broadband provider’s existing low-income internet program.</li></ul>
