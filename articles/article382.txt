<p>Dear Madam Speaker: (Dear Madam President:)<br/><br/>Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1622(d), provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the <em>Federal Register</em> and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date.  Consistent with this provision, I have sent to the <em>Federal Register</em> the enclosed notice, stating that the emergency declared in Proclamation 7463 with respect to the terrorist attacks on the United States of September 11, 2001, is to continue in effect for an additional year.<br/><br/>The terrorist threat that led to the declaration on September 14, 2001, of a national emergency continues.  For this reason, I have determined that it is necessary to continue in effect after September 14, 2022, the national emergency with respect to the terrorist threat.</p>
<p class="has-text-align-right">                               Sincerely,  <br/><br/>                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>
