<p>This afternoon, I spoke with Senators Schumer and Manchin and offered my support for the agreement they have reached on a bill to fight inflation and lower costs for American families.  </p>
<p>With this agreement, we have a chance to make prescription drugs cheaper by allowing Medicare to negotiate lower prices and we can lower health insurance costs for 13 million Americans, by an average of $800 a year, for families covered under the Affordable Care Act.  </p>
<p>We will improve our energy security and tackle the climate crisis – by providing tax credits and investments for energy projects.   This will create thousands of new jobs and help lower energy costs in the future.</p>
<p>This bill will reduce the deficit beyond the record setting $1.7 trillion in deficit reduction we have already achieved this year, which will help fight inflation as well.  </p>
<p>And we will pay for all of this by requiring big corporations to pay their fair share of taxes, with no tax increases at all for families making under $400,000 a year.</p>
<p>This is the action the American people have been waiting for.  This addresses the problems of today – high health care costs and overall inflation – as well as investments in our energy security for the future.  </p>
<p>I will have more to say on this later.  For now, I want to thank Senator Schumer and Senator Manchin for the extraordinary effort that it took to reach this result.  </p>
<p>If enacted, this legislation will be historic, and I urge the Senate to move on this bill as soon as possible, and for the House to follow as well. </p>
