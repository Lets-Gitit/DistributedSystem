<p>The President is announcing five new federal judicial nominees, all of whom are extraordinarily qualified, experienced, and devoted to the rule of law and our Constitution.<br/><br/>These choices also continue to fulfill the President’s promise to ensure that the nation’s courts reflect the diversity that is one of our greatest assets as a country — both in terms of personal and professional backgrounds.<br/><br/>For example, the slate includes: </p>
<ul><li>A nominee who would be the first Asian American judge to ever serve on the Seventh Circuit.</li><li>A nominee who would be the first Hispanic judge to ever serve on the Ninth Circuit from Washington State.</li><li>A nominee who would be the first Hispanic woman to ever serve as a federal judge in the state of Illinois.</li><li>A nominee who would be would be the only judge of color currently serving on the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, and the second African American judge to ever serve on the District of Delaware.</li></ul>
<p>This is President Biden’s sixteenth round of nominees for federal judicial positions and his fourth slate of nominations in 2022, bringing the number of announced federal judicial nominees to 90.</p>
<p>President Biden has spent decades committed to strengthening the federal bench, which is why he continues to move rapidly to fill judicial vacancies. And he has won confirmation of the most lower court judges for the first year of a presidency since the Kennedy Administration.<br/></p>
