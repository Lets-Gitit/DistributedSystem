<p>Today, the Biden-Harris Administration recognizes Transgender Day of Visibility, an annual celebration of the resilience, achievements, and joy of transgender people in the United States and around the world. Every American deserves the freedom to be themselves. But far too many transgender Americans still face systemic barriers, discrimination, and acts of violence. Today, the Administration once again condemns the proliferation of dangerous anti-transgender legislative attacks that have been introduced and passed in state legislatures around the country. The evidence is clear that these types of bills stigmatize and worsen the well-being and mental health of transgender kids, and they put loving and supportive families across the country at risk of discrimination and harassment. As the President has said, these bills are government overreach at its worst, they are un-American, and they must stop.<br/><br/>Transgender people are some of the bravest people in our nation. But nobody should have to be brave just to be themselves. Today, the Biden Administration announced new actions to support the mental health of transgender children, remove barriers that transgender people face accessing critical government services, and improve the visibility of transgender people in our nation’s data.</p>
<p><strong>Reinforcing federal protections for transgender kids. </strong>The Justice Department announced today that it has <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-reinforces-federal-nondiscrimination-obligations-letter-state-officials">issued a letter</a> to all state attorneys general reminding them of federal constitutional and statutory provisions that protect transgender youth against discrimination, including when those youth seek gender-affirming care.<br/><br/><strong>Advancing dignity, respect, and self-determination for transgender people by improving the traveler experience. </strong>For far too long, transgender, non-binary, and gender non-conforming Americans have faced significant barriers to travelling safely and many have not had their gender identity respected as they travel within the United States and around the world. To create a safer and more dignified travel experience, the Biden Administration is announcing the following changes.</p>
<ul><li><strong>The Department of State</strong> is <a href="https://www.state.gov/press-releases/">announcing</a> that beginning on April 11, 2022, all U.S. citizens will be able select an “X” as their gender marker on their U.S. passport application. This is a major step in delivering on the President’s commitment to expand access to accurate identification documents for transgender and non-binary Americans. Information on how to apply will be available at <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/need-passport/selecting-your-gender-marker.html">travel.state.gov/gender</a>.<br/></li><li><strong>The Department of Homeland Security</strong> is <a href="https://dhs.gov/news/2022/03/31/dhs-announces-new-measures-better-serve-transgender-non-binary-and-gender-non">announcing</a> several important reforms to improve the traveler experience for all Americans, particularly for transgender Americans:<br/><ul><li><strong>Implementing enhanced screening technology. </strong>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will soon begin updating its Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) body scanners with new technology that will increase security and efficiency by reducing false alarm rates and pat-downs for the traveling public. By replacing the current, gender-based system with this more accurate technology, TSA will improve the customer experience of transgender travelers who have previously been required to undergo additional screening due to alarms in sensitive areas.  This new technology will help to improve the experience of travelers, particularly those who are transgender and non-binary travelers. TSA will begin deploying this new technology in airports throughout the country later this year.<br/></li><li><strong>Expanding airline partnerships to enhance the overall travel experience. </strong> TSA is working closely with air carriers across the nation to promote the use and acceptance of the “X” gender marker to ensure more efficient and accurate passenger processing. As of March 31st, two major domestic air carriers already offer a third gender marker option in their travel-reservation systems, with a third air carrier planning to offer this option in the Fall of 2022.<br/></li><li><strong>Streamlining identity validation. </strong>TSA has updated its Standard Operating Procedures to remove gender considerations when validating a traveler’s identification at airport security checkpoints. This ensures that TSOs can accurately and efficiently validate each traveler’s identity while avoiding unnecessary delays.<br/></li><li><strong>Updating TSA PreCheck and CBP Trusted Traveler Programs enrollment to include “X” gender markers.</strong> The Department of Homeland Security is beginning the process of adding “X” gender markers options in Trusted Traveler programs and the TSA PreCheck program to enhance access for transgender, non-binary, and gender non-conforming travelers to these programs.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p><strong>Providing resources for transgender kids and their families. </strong>Transgender children are put at higher risk of attempted suicide or mental health challenges when they face bullying, rejection, or denial of health care. The Biden Administration is releasing several new resources to help transgender children and their parents thrive:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Providing mental health resources for transgender youth. </strong>In recent months, multiple states have removed critical information about mental health resources for LGBTQI+ youth from official state websites. Transgender youth often face significant barriers in accessing supportive resources, and are at greater risk of attempted suicide. In response, the Department of Health and Human Services released a <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/lgbtqi">new website</a> that offers resources for transgender and LGBTQI+ youth, their parents, and providers. These resources include best practices for affirming an LGBTQI+ child, and information about suicide prevention services.<br/></li><li><strong>Expanding trainings to support transgender and nonbinary students in schools.</strong> The Office of Safe and Supportive Schools in the Department of Education will offer new training for schools with experts and school leaders who will discuss the challenges faced by many transgender and nonbinary students and strategies and actions for providing support.<br/></li><li><strong>Confirming the positive impact of gender affirming care on youth mental health.</strong> The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has posted <a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/blog/lgbtqi-youth-all-americans-deserve-evidence-based-care">LGBTQI+ Youth – Like All Americans, They Deserve Evidence-Based Care</a>, in which Miriam Delphin-Rittmon, Ph.D., HHS Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use and the leader of SAMHSA, shares how to engage LGBTQI+ youth, the evidence behind the positive effects of gender affirming care, and available resources for LGBTQI+ youth, their families, providers, community organizations, and government agencies.<br/></li><li><strong>Confirming that gender-affirming care is trauma-informed care. </strong>The National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN), which is administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, is releasing new <a href="https://www.nctsn.org/sites/default/files/resources/fact-sheet/gender-affirming-care-is-trauma-informed-care.pdf">information for providers</a> confirming that providing gender-affirming care is neither child maltreatment nor malpractice.<br/></li><li><strong>Providing resources on the importance of gender affirming care for children and adolescents.</strong> The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health has developed a <a href="https://opa.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/2022-03/gender-affirming-care-young-people-march-2022.pdf">resource</a> to inform parents and guardians, educators, and other persons supporting children and adolescents with information on what is gender-affirming care and why it is important to transgender, nonbinary, and other gender expansive young people’s well-being.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Improving access to federal services and benefits for transgender Americans.</strong> With support and coordination from the U.S. Digital Service, federal agencies are removing barriers to access government services by improving the customer experience of transgender, non-binary, and gender non-conforming Americans:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Accessing retirement savings. </strong>The Social Security Administration is <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/releases/">announcing</a> that it is removing the requirement that transgender people show proof of identity such as doctor’s notes in order to update their gender information in their social security record by the fall of 2022. This will significantly improve transgender individuals’ experience in accessing their retirement benefits, obtaining health care, and applying for jobs.<br/></li><li><strong>Filing an employment discrimination complaint</strong>. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/newsroom/eeoc-add-non-binary-gender-option-discrimination-charge-intake-process">announcing</a> that it will promote greater equity and inclusion for members of the transgender community by giving individuals the option to select an “X” gender marker during the voluntary self-identification questions that are part of the intake process for filing a charge of discrimination.<br/></li><li><strong>Applying for federal student aid.</strong> The Department of Education plans to propose next month that the 2023-24 FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) will include an opportunity for applicants to indicate their gender identity as well as their race/ethnicity when applying for federal financial aid. The questions, which will be posted for public comment, will be in a survey that accompanies the application. This privacy-protected information would help to inform the Department about possible barriers students, including transgender and nonbinary students, face in the financial aid process.<br/></li><li><strong>Visiting the White House. </strong>The White House Office of Management and Administration is announcing that it is beginning the process of implementing updates that will improve the White House campus entry process for transgender, gender non-conforming, and non-binary visitors by adding an “X” gender marker option to the White House Worker and Visitor Entry System (WAVES) system. This change will ensure that transgender, non-binary, and gender nonconforming people can visit the People’s House in a manner that respects and affirms their gender identity.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Advancing inclusion and visibility in federal data. </strong>In too many critical federal surveys and data systems, transgender, non-binary, and gender non-conforming people are not fully reflected. To improve visibility for transgender Americans, agencies are announcing new actions to expand the collection and use of sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data.</p>
<ul><li><strong>The White House</strong> announced that the President’s proposed Fiscal Year 23 budget includes $10 million in funding for additional critical research on how to best add questions about sexual orientation and gender identity to the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, one of our nation’s largest and most important surveys of American households. This data collection will help the federal government better serve the LGBTQI+ community by providing valuable information on their jobs, educational attainment, home ownership, and more.<br/></li><li><strong>The Department of Health and Human Services</strong> has <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/QBank/Report.aspx?1225">released</a> the findings of the federal government’s first-ever user research testing conducted with transgender Americans on how they want to see themselves reflected on Federal IDs. This groundbreaking user research by the Collaborating Center for Question Design and Evaluation Research (CCQDER) at the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) directly informed the State Department’s adopted definition of the “X” gender marker.<br/></li><li><strong>The Department of Health and Human Services </strong><a href="https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/who-we-are/nih-director/statements/nih-funded-nasem-report-highlights-critical-need-sgm-related-data-collection">has released</a> a comprehensive new consensus study on Measuring Sex, Gender Identity, and Sexual Orientation. This work, commissioned by the National Institutes of Health and carried out by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, will inform additional data collections and future research in how to best serve LGBTQI+ Americans.</li></ul>
<p><strong>These announcements build on the Biden-Harris Administration’s historic work to advance equality for transgender Americans since taking office, including:</strong><br/><br/><strong>Combatting legislative attacks on transgender kids at the state level.</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Condemning anti-transgender bills. </strong>The President has consistently made clear that legislative attacks against transgender youth are un-American, and are bullying disguised as legislation. In his March, 2022 State of the Union Address, the President said, “The onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families is wrong. As I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I will always have your back as your President, so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential.” The White House has also hosted listening sessions with transgender youth and advocates in states across the country that are impacted by anti-transgender legislative attacks.<br/></li><li><strong>Reaffirming that transgender children have the right to access gender-affirming health care. </strong>In March, following state actions that aim to target parents and doctors who provide gender-affirming care to transgender children with child abuse investigations, the Department of Health and Human Services <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2022/03/02/statement-hhs-secretary-xavier-becerra-reaffirming-hhs-support-and-protection-for-lgbtqi-children-and-youth.html">took multiple actions</a> to support transgender children in receiving the care they need and promised to use every tool available to protect LGTBQI+ children and support their families.<br/></li><li><strong>Department of Justice statements of interest and amicus briefs.</strong> The Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division has filed Statements of Interest and amicus briefs in several matters to protect the constitutional rights of transgender individuals, including in <em>Brandt v. Rutledge</em>, a lawsuit challenging legislation restricting access to gender-affirming care for transgender youth; <em>B.P.J. v. West Virginia State Board of Education</em>, a lawsuit challenging legislation restricting participation of transgender students in school sports; <em>Corbitt v. Taylor</em>, a lawsuit challenging legislation restricting the ability to change gender markers on state driver’s licenses; and <em>Adams v. School Board of St. John’s County</em>, which involves the right of a transgender boy to use the boys’ restroom at his school.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Advancing civil rights protections for transgender Americans</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Fighting for passage of the Equality Act. </strong>President Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/25/fact-sheet-the-equality-act-will-provide-long-overdue-civil-rights-protections-for-millions-of-americans/">continues to call</a> on the Senate to pass the Equality Act, legislation which will provide long overdue federal civil rights protections to transgender and LGBTQI+ Americans and their families.

As a result of that Order, the Departments of <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/05/10/hhs-announces-prohibition-sex-discrimination-includes-discrimination-basis-sexual-orientation-gender-identity.html">Health and Human Services</a>, <a href="https://www.hud.gov/press/press_releases_media_advisories/hud_no_21_021">Housing and Urban Development</a>, <a href="https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-confirms-title-ix-protects-students-discrimination-based-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity">Education</a>, <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-clarifies-discrimination-by-lenders-on-basis-of-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-is-illegal/">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a>, and <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/page/file/1383026/download">Justice</a> have announced that they are expanding non-discrimination protections for transgender people in health care, housing, education, credit and lending services, and community safety programs.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Supporting transgender service members and veterans</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Reversing the discriminatory ban on transgender servicemembers.</strong> In his first week in office, President Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/25/fact-sheet-president-biden-signs-executive-order-enabling-all-qualified-americans-to-serve-their-country-in-uniform/">signed</a> an Executive Order reversing the ban on openly transgender servicemembers serving in the Armed Forces, enabling all qualified Americans to serve their country in uniform.

In June, VA also announced that it is beginning the regulatory process to remove restrictions that prevent transgender veterans from accessing the gender-affirming care they need and deserve.</li></ul>

The Executive Order charges agencies with building inclusive cultures for transgender employees by: expanding the availability of gender-neutral facilities in Federal buildings; ensuring that employee services support transgender employees who wish to legally, medically or socially transition; advancing the use of non-binary gender markers and pronouns in Federal employment processes; and expanding access to gender-affirming care and inclusive health benefits.<br/></li><li><strong>Appointing historic transgender leaders. </strong>The Biden-Harris Administration includes barrier-breaking LGBTQI+ leaders, including Assistant Secretary for Health Dr. Rachel Levine, who is the first openly transgender person ever confirmed by the U.S. Senate. In October, she was also <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/10/19/statements-officials-us-department-health-and-human-services-commemorating-first-openly-transgender-four-star-officer-first-female-four-star-admiral.html">named a four-star admiral</a> in the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, becoming the first openly transgender person to hold that rank in any of the country’s uniformed services. Over 14 percent of Biden-Harris Administration appointees identify as LGBTQI+.</li></ul>

As the President has said, Pulse Nightclub is hallowed ground.</li></ul>
