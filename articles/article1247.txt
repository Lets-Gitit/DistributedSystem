<p>TO THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES:</p>
<p>Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the <em>Federal Register</em> and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date.  In accordance with this provision, I have sent to the <em>Federal Register</em> for publication the enclosed notice stating that the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13694 of April 1, 2015, with respect to significant malicious cyber-enabled activities, is to continue in effect beyond April 1, 2022.</p>
<p>Significant malicious cyber-enabled activities originating from, or directed by persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States.  Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order 13694 with respect to significant malicious cyber-enabled activities.</p>
<p>                               JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.</p>
<p>THE WHITE HOUSE,</p>
<p>    March 30, 2022.</p>
