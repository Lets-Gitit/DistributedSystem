<p>I am deeply saddened by the passing of Archbishop Chrysostomos II—a man of remarkable conviction and courage who led Cyprus’ Greek Orthodox Christian Church with grace during a pivotal period.<br/><br/>Archbishop Chrysostomos II was a dedicated leader who never shied away from speaking up for the most vulnerable communities in Cyprus.  He was also steadfast in his commitment to the peaceful resolution of the conflict in Cyprus. In 2014, I had the honor of meeting with the Archbishop in Nicosia. I was touched by his compassion—he was a leader dedicated to interfaith dialogue and committed to unity among all religious communities in Cyprus.<br/><br/>Jill and I offer our deepest condolences to Cyprus’ Greek Orthodox Christian Church, the Republic of Cyprus, and all those who followed or were positively impacted by the Archbishop’s spiritual guidance.</p>
