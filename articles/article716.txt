<p>Today, President Biden convened nine Democratic Governors from across the country to discuss efforts to defend reproductive rights. These Governors collectively represent tens of millions of women. They are each taking action to protect access to abortion care, including by: announcing funding for reproductive health care services; educating the public; supporting the codification of the right to access an abortion into state law and state constitutions; issuing executive actions to defend patients, including out-of-state patients, providers, and third parties; and even taking action <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2022/06/24/west-coast-states-launch-new-multi-state-commitment-to-reproductive-freedom-standing-united-on-protecting-abortion-access/">together</a> to support abortion access. These steps by Democratic Governors are critical as states enact and enforce laws to ban abortion and criminalize their citizens in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision in <em>Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, </em>which overturned <em>Roe v. Wade</em>.</p>
<p>In the meeting, the President highlighted the impact the decision will continue to have on the health and safety of millions of women. He reiterated <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/06/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-actions-in-light-of-todays-supreme-court-decision-on-dobbs-v-jackson-womens-health-organization/">his Administration’s commitment</a> to defend women’s freedom to travel for lawful abortion care, as well as access to critical, FDA-approved medications for reproductive health care, including medication abortion and contraception. The President made clear that the filibuster should not stand in the way of restoring <em>Roe</em> into federal law. And he warned of Congressional Republican efforts to pass a nationwide ban on abortion.</p>
<p>The President thanked the Governors for their work on this issue, and told them his Administration looks forward to continued partnership to protect access to reproductive health care.</p>
<p>The conversation was moderated by Jennifer Klein, Director of the White House Gender Policy Council. Governors from today’s meeting included:</p>
