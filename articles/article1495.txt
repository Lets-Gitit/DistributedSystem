<p>Today, Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice and White House Intergovernmental Affairs Director Julie Rodriguez convened the third national meeting of The White House Community Violence Intervention Collaborative (CVIC), a cohort of 16 jurisdictions committed to using American Rescue Plan funding or other public funding to scale and strengthen their CVI infrastructure. Investing in evidence-based community violence interventions (CVI) to reduce gun violence is a key pillar of President Biden’s comprehensive strategy to prevent and respond to gun crime. Mayors, law enforcement leaders, CVI experts, and representatives from more than a dozen philanthropic institutions participated in today’s meeting, along with the four lead training and technical assistance (TTA) providers—Cities United, Community Based Public Safety Collective, Health Alliance for Violence Intervention (HAVI), and the National Institute of Criminal Justice Reform—and Hyphen, which anchors the initiative.</p>
<p>Announced in June 2021, the Collaborative is an 18-month initiative to enhance partnerships and coordination in each jurisdiction and to facilitate peer-to-peer learning around effective community-based public safety strategies. National experts and federal agencies are providing training and technical assistance (TTA) to help communities assess their existing public safety ecosystem, identify gaps, and build the capacity to expand programming that saves lives and provides needed services to communities impacted by gun violence.<br/><br/>To date, CVIC jurisdictions have committed more than $300 million of American Rescue Plan funds to invest in public safety and CVI strategies. Domestic Policy Advisor Susan Rice and Intergovernmental Affairs Director Julie Rodriguez called upon CVIC participants – including mayors, law enforcement, community violence intervention leaders, and philanthropic supporters – to expediently deploy these dollars so community violence intervention programs and CVIC communities can expand their capacity ahead of the summer months, when gun crime historically increases.</p>
